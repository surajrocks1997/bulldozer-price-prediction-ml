    "# Predicting the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal is to predict the sale price of bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of bulldozer given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    ">The data is downloaded from kaggle blue book for bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project is to build machine learning project which minimizes RMSLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Kaggle provides data dictionary detailing about all of the features of the dataset. You can view the data with the name: `Data Dictionary.xlsx`"
